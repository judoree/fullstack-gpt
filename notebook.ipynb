      "\n",
      "2. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and place them on a baking sheet lined with foil. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute.\n",

      "**Vegetarian Chicken Tikka Masala**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "- 1 lb firm tofu or paneer, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt (you can use dairy-free yogurt for a vegan version)\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons ground cumin\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons paprika\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon garam masala\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes\n",
      "- 1 cup coconut cream (or dairy-free heavy cream alternative)\n",
      "- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "1. Follow the same marinating process as the original recipe, but instead of chicken, marinate the tofu or paneer in the yogurt and spice mixture. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. Instead of baking, you can pan-fry or grill the marinated tofu or paneer until they develop a slight char and are cooked through.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. Proceed with the recipe as instructed, replacing the chicken with the cooked tofu or paneer. Simmer in the sauce to allow the flavors to meld together.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed, and garnish with chopped cilantro before serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** Tofu and paneer have different textures, so the cooking time may vary. Tofu can be more delicate, so handle it carefully to prevent it from breaking apart.\n",
